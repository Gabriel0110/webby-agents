 *
 * Demonstrates advanced synergy:
 * 1) Shared memory among multiple agents
 * 2) Interleaved chat approach for multi-agent analysis
 *    - Round-robin the agents in a while loop until a convergence condition is met
 * 3) Aggregator agent merges everything into a final answer
 * 
 * Note: This example showcases very advanced usage. Not everything is necessary, but
 * it demonstrates the full capabilities of the AdvancedAgentTeam class. Pick and choose
 * the features that are most relevant to your use case.
